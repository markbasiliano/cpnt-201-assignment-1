### Contact Deadpool

**Hey there, you magnificent weirdo!**

Got a question, a job offer, or just want to share your favorite taco joint? I’m all ears (and probably a bit of a mouth). Here’s how you can reach me!

### **1. Email Me**

Got something serious to discuss (or not-so-serious)? Shoot me an email at:
**<mercwithamouth@taco-mail.com>**

(Disclaimer: I might be too busy fighting bad guys or munching on tacos to respond right away.)

### **2. Social Media**

Catch me on the interwebs! I’m known to post the occasional meme, sneak peek of my adventures, or just random nonsense. Hit me up on:

- **Twitter**: [@Deadpool](https://twitter.com/Deadpool)
- **Instagram**: [@DeadpoolOfficial](https://instagram.com/DeadpoolOfficial)
- **Facebook**: [Deadpool Fan Page](https://facebook.com/Deadpool)

### **3. Fan Mail**

If you want to send me a note, a taco recipe, or just fan art of me in ridiculous poses, feel free to send it to:
**Deadpool's Secret Lair**  
123 Mercenary Ave.  
Wade’s Hideout, Marvel Universe

(Just remember: I’m not responsible for any unsolicited love letters!)

### **4. Book Me for Events**

Looking to spice up your event with a little chaos and humor? Fill out the form below, and my *assistant* (who is totally not just me in a different outfit) will get back to you:

- **Event Type**: ______________________
- **Date & Time**: ______________________
- **Location**: ______________________
- **Details**: ______________________

*Remember, I can’t promise I won’t show up with tacos and a questionable playlist!*

### **5. Emergency Situations**

(Seriously, this is just a prank call line, but I might pick up and entertain you!)

**Stay awesome, and may your tacos be ever plentiful!**

### **- Deadpool**
